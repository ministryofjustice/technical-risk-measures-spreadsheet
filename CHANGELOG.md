# Changelog

Breaking changes which require manual edits to an existing spreadsheet before
running the new version of the script will be recorded here, with instructions
for how to make those edits.

Breaking changes are those which add, remove or reorder columns or rows.
Updates to the wording or descriptions of criteria are not considered to be
breaking changes for the purposes of this script, although they may mean you
need to review your existing data to see whether it needs updating for the new
definitions.

All changes will be documented in commit messages, so look there for detail on
other changes which are not included here.

## 1.0

Supports the [documentation as of 2019-07-03](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/technical-risk-measures/tree/37f6aa33969a28f8890c5404d3e29fbeca0f424a). One
non-breaking wording change made since then (renaming "atrophy" to "decay") is
also supported.

Does everything needed to set up a new spreadsheet from scratch.
